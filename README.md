# Leonardo Project

As part of the CMPT-375 class (Web Applications) at Westminster, a group of 4 coders and 3 designers had a project with the end goal of helping real-life clients create a web application suited for their needs. The client, The Leonardo Museum in Utah, asked our group to make it easier for members to get exclusive content, calender updates, membership cards and more. We created a web application from scratch, implementing both the back-end, and the front-end of the application using Django as a framework. The project helped us learn what goes into the process of developing software, including the technical computer skills, the communications skills, and the project managments skills needed to complete tasks efficent and effective.
